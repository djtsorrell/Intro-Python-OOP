# Radioactive Decay

This project involves a python class which simulates radioactive decay. Once the simulation is complete, the program can then calculate a value of the half-life of the isotope instance. The program also includes a `visual` method, which uses `matplotlib` to create a coloured grid with the decayed and undecayed nuclei represented as square cells.
