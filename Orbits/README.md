# Orbital Simulation

A Python simulation of orbital motion. The program uses Euler-Cromer method of
numerical integration to obtain bodies' velocity and position. Gravitational
forces are calculated using Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. It should be
noted that this is a many-body problem; therefore, the program calculates the
forces and resulting accelerations, velocities and positions for **all** bodies.
Below is one example of the simulation working. Alongside the animation of the
orbital motion, the kinetic energy of the system is plotted.
